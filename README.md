Research phase
I first saw the plane made by MIT that was completely propelled by ion thrusters.LINK

The plane was only able to sustain flight for 10 seconds.

The type of ionic truster they used was extremely similar to MARK 1/2 of the ionic truster made by Plasma Channel. Link

Later, plasma channel made a mark 3 using convergence to increase the trust. LINK

His one single section was able to output 3.1 m/s

His module weighed around 700 grams(estimate)

Goals
A truster that can produce >3.1 m/s

A thruster that weighs > 500 grams

A sustained flight of < 30 seconds

Ion truster designs

The thruster utilizes an angle of 140 degrees and a distance of 2.5

The thruster utilizes an angle of 140 degrees and a distance of 3


The thruster utilizes an angle of 140 degrees and a distance of 3.5

The thruster utilizes an angle of 150 degrees and a distance of 2.5

The thruster utilizes an angle of 160 degrees and a distance of 2.5

Data collection

Optimization
After I collected the data from each of the different ion trusters, I made equations to see what would be the most optimal for each of the 3 data points I was testing: angle, distance, and scale. The most optimal was xxx angle with x.x distance apart and xx% scale.
